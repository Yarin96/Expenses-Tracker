# Expenses Tracker  
---
Track and manage your expenses with this expenses tracker React app.  

In this project I mainly focused on the basics of React.js like managing components, states, props etc.  
For the moment the available features are to add expenses, present the overall data via chart bars and filter by years.  
I plan to improve this project with more advanced features in the future.
